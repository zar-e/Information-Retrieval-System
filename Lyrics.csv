"""Tango: Cuesta Abajo""",Brian May,"Si arrastre por este mundo La verguenza de haber sido Y el dolor de ya no ser, Bajo el ala del sombrero Cuantas veces embozada Una lagrima asomada Yo no pude contener.  Si cruce por los caminos Como un paria que el destino Se empeno en deshacer; Si fui flojo, si fui ciego, Solo quiero que comprendan El valor que representa El coraje de querer.  Era para mi la vida entera, Como un sol de primavera, Mi esperanza y mi pasion. Sabia que en el mundo no cabia Toda la humilde alegria De mi pobre corazon. Ahora, cuesta abajo en mi rodada, Las ilusiones pasadas Ya no las puedo arrancar. Sueno con el pasado que anoro, El tiempo viejo que lloro Y que nunca volvera...  Por seguir tras de sus huellas Yo bebi incansablemente En mi copa de dolor; Pero nadie comprendia Que si todo yo lo daba, En cada vuelta dejaba Pedazos de corazon...  Ahora, triste en la pendiente, Solitario y ya vencido, Yo me quiero confesar; Si aquella boca mentia El amor que me ofrecia Por aquellos ojos brujos Yo habria dado siempre mas..."

And old townies are tired of the beaches and bars being packed so tight. And bridges, and traffic, and inlets, are locked in their fight.  And on these boats, ride the hopes of working class boys, dreaming of girls, from far away points. And better things. Like winter flings. And longing after spring has sprung. And they fly north when winter's done. And we get burned in summer's sun.  Fountains and fluorescent lights. When season has come the snowbirds have crowded the nights. And young townies and tourists find unlikely love at first sight. And swear that they're never leaving and that is their plight.  This winter is lasting forever, at least for tonight. And I know that you're never leaving, until your flight, takes you off, and out of my arms, and into the air, so far from your charms, that I can not bare, another year, in this long forgotten beach town, we once shared.

And old townies are tired of the beaches and bars being packed so tight. And bridges, and traffic, and inlets, are locked in their fight.  And on these boats, ride the hopes of working class boys, dreaming of girls, from far away points. And better things. Like winter flings. And longing after spring has sprung. And they fly north when winter's done. And we get burned in summer's sun.  Fountains and fluorescent lights. When season has come the snowbirds have crowded the nights. And young townies and tourists find unlikely love at first sight. And swear that they're never leaving and that is their plight.  This winter is lasting forever, at least for tonight. And I know that you're never leaving, until your flight, takes you off, and out of my arms, and into the air, so far from your charms, that I can not bare, another year, in this long forgotten beach town, we once shared.

And I will chase the boy in you away""  Then she smiled And we talked for awhile Then we walked for a mile to the sea We sat on the sands, and a boy took her hand But I saw the sun rise as a man  Ten years have gone by Since I looked in her eye But the memory lingers I go back in my mind To the very first time The touch of her fingers  Was a hot afternoon The last day of June And the sun was a demon The clouds were afraid One ten in the shade ..."

"""Alone With You""",Alpha Rev,"Desperation is replaced By the business of good intentions Now the path I'm left to face Is the length of time I'm treading water  I've been cracked enough to break Bruised, reduced, enough to scatter As I step into this place The knife, the rose, the sparrow come together  Alone with you Amidst all the weather I'm alone with you There is nothing better  On the brink of a fading heart Another day I lead forgotten Trying to keep up staying sharp Lately feel the blind abandon  I'm alone with you Amidst all the weather I'm alone with you For there is, for there is no other  For there is no other There is no other There is no other There is no other"
"""Start Over Again""",Addison Road,"Open up your eyes Awake, arise Love like a hand reaches down And pulls us up from the dirty ground  Now is the time To step from the dark into the light Cause you can't change what you've done But you can choose who you'll become  [CHORUS] Every moment is a second chance At starting over, at starting over Move from the past to the present tense You can start over, start over again  If you feel ashamed Of the choices that you've made You can be whole again And return to your innocence  [CHORUS] Every moment is a second chance At starting over, at starting over Move from the past to the present tense You can start over, start over again  Yesterday is gone Today is all you've got You don't have to be who you've been You can change within It's never too late To start over again  [CHORUS] Every moment is a second chance At starting over, at starting over Move from the past to the present tense You can start over, start over again"
"""Outlaws And Renegades""",Gretchen Wilson,"Well, just the other day I was drivin' down the road And I was listenin' to the stuff comin' out of the music world Well, I didn't recognize a single song or none of the names But it didn't really matter 'cause they all seemed to sound the same  Where's all the outlaws and renegades? The Lord knows, I miss those days When they said what they thought What they thought was what was on your mind  Did all the outlaws and renegades Pack up and go home? I guess the outlaw and renegade days have gone  Well, I got home and I turned on my TV And I saw some politician bitchin' 'bout the way it should be He said a vote for me is a vote to be free at last But today I just paid 4 dollars for a gallon of gas  Oh, where's all the outlaws and renegades? The Lord knows, I miss those days When they said what they thought What they thought was what was on your mind  Did all the outlaws and renegades Pack up and go home? I guess the outlaw and renegade days have gone  Oh, where's all the outlaws and renegades? The Lord knows, I miss those days When they said what they thought What they thought was what was on your mind, yeah  Did all the outlaws and renegades Pack up and go home? I guess the outlaw and renegade days have gone  Yeah, I guess the outlaw and renegade days have gone Just gone I'm talkin' about Johnny Cash, Waylon Jennings I mean, Helson, give us a little Willie Nelson, come on"
