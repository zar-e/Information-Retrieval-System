"""Little Things""",Bobby Goldsboro,"Little things that you do make me glad I'm in love with you Little things that you say make me glad that I feel this way The way you smile, the way you hold my hand And when I'm down you always understand You know I love those  Little things in my ear that you say when there's no one near Little things that you do let me know that your love is true When we walk, you like to hold my hand And when we talk you tell me I'm your man You know I love those  Little things that I hear, the little things you whisper in my ear I know there ain't nobody else like you No one could do the little things you do  Little things that you do make me glad I'm in love with you Little things that you say make me glad that I feel this way When we walk, you like to hold my hand And when we talk you tell me I'm your man You know I love those  Little things that I hear, the little things you whisper in my ear I know there ain't nobody else like you No one could do the little things you do"
"""Hot Patootie""",Brian May,"Hey pussycat What's going down  Whatever happened to saturday night When you dressed up sharp and you felt all right It don't seem the same since cosmic light Came into my life, I thought I was divine, wo wo  I used to go for a ride with a chick who'd go And listen to the music on the radio A saxophone was blowing on a rock'n'roll show We climbed in the back seat, and really had a good time  Hot patootie, bless my soul, I really love that rock and roll Hot patootie, bless my soul, I really love that rock and roll  My head was swimming from the perfume I smelled My hands kind of fumbled with her white plastic belt I'd taste her baby pink lipstick and that's when I'd melt She'd whisper in my ear tonight she really was mine  Get back in front, put some hair oil on Buddy Holly was singing his very last song (bop sho wop) With your arms around your girl you'd try to sing along (bop sho wop) It felt pretty good (bop sho wop) because you'd really had a good time  Hot patootie, bless my soul (yeah yeah) I really love that rock and roll (rock and roll) Hot patootie, bless my soul, I really love that rock and roll Hot patootie, bless my soul (I really love) I really love that rock and roll Hot patootie, bless my soul, I really love that rock and roll  Hey  Hot patootie, bless my soul, I really love that rock and roll Hot patootie, bless my soul, I really love that Hot patootie, bless my soul (I really love) I really love that rock and roll Hot patootie, bless my soul, I really love that (yeah yeah yeah) Hot patootie, bless my soul, I really love that rock and roll (I really love that) Hot patootie, bless my soul, I really love that rock and roll Hot patootie, bless my soul, I really love that rock and rock and rock and roll Hot patootie!"
"""Let Me Love You For Tonight""",Bobby Goldsboro,I could never find the words to say Just how much you mean to me And for me to say I love you Would not be fair to you or me Though I'm leaving with the morning sun These precious days we won't forget And when I kiss you for the last time We will part with no regrets  Let me love you for tonight And when I leave you in the morning I will leave no strings behind to tie you down And I will keep you in my mind I'll think of you from time to time And who knows I might pass this way again And who knows maybe you might take me in  This could never last forever And there's no reason to pretend Though we had a good thing going We both knew it had to end Let us make no foolish promises Just let me love you for a while And when the sun comes up tomorrow I will leave you with a smile  Let me love you for tonight And when I leave you in the morning I will leave no strings behind to tie you down And I will keep you in my mind I'll think of you from time to time And who knows I might pass this way again And who knows maybe you might take me in  There are many things that I could say But they might only cause you pain And all our days were built with sunshine And the light might bring the rain Let me love you like I know I can And if you give yourself to me In the shadows of this evening We will build sweet memories  Let me love you for tonight And when I leave you in the morning I will leave no strings behind to tie you down And I will keep you in my mind I'll think of you from time to time And who knows I might pass this way again And who knows maybe you might take me in
"""Passenger""",OneRepublic,"I saw your face, stuck in a crowd Silently screaming out loud I felt the beat echo your heart Throw me a line 'cause it's too far  All that you want, all that you see All that you thought that you believe  Is it enough? Do you think it's too much? You say you only trust what you can touch  All you got to do is reach out for it  All that you want Is standing right in front of you All that you need Is love All that you want Is standing right in front of you All that you need Is love  Walked to the ledge, put out my hands Scared to the bones of where I'd land Traded my fears, traded my thoughts They disappear behind your walls  All that I want, all that I need All that I thought I believed Was it enough? Sure not too much? Now you're the only thing that I can trust  All you got to do is reach out for it  All that you want Is standing right in front of you All that you need Is love All that you want Is standing right in front of you All that you need Is love  It's all for you It's all for you"
